# Agentic Starter Kits

</div>

## Purpose
Production-ready agent templates to build and deploy LLM-powered agents. Run locally (e.g. with Ollama/Llama Stack) or deploy to Red Hat OpenShift. Each agent has step-by-step docs.

## Agents
Choose an agent and follow its README for setup and deployment:

- **[LangGraph ReAct](./agents/base/langgraph_react_agent/README.md)** – General-purpose agent using a ReAct loop: it reasons and calls tools (e.g. search, math) step by step. Built with LangGraph and LangChain.
- **[LlamaIndex WebSearch](./agents/base/llamaindex_websearch_agent/README.md)** – Agent built on LlamaIndex that uses a web search tool to query the internet and use the results in its answers.
- **[OpenAI Responses](./agents/base/openai_responses_agent/README.md)** – Minimal agent with no framework: only the OpenAI Python client and an Action/Observation loop with tools. Use with OpenAI or any compatible API.
- **[LangGraph Agentic RAG](./agents/community/langgraph_agentic_rag/README.md)** – RAG agent that indexes documents in a vector store (Milvus) and retrieves relevant chunks to augment the LLM’s answers with your own data.

## Deployment Options
Agents in this repository can support two deployment modes:

### 🖥️ Local Development
- Run agents on your local machine
- Use Llama Stack server with Ollama for model serving
- Ideal for development, testing, and experimentation
- No cloud infrastructure required

### ☁️ Production Deployment
- Deploy agents to Red Hat OpenShift Cluster
- Containerized deployment with Kubernetes
- Production-grade scaling and monitoring
- CI/CD ready
